                        Primates belongs to the group of mammals known as "Placentialia", characterized by the prescence of
                        the placenta, an organ that nourishes the fetus during development. Other placental orders include
                        Carnivora, Artiodactyla, and Proboscidea. Additionally, carnivora belongs to a group of placentals known 
                        as "Euarchontaglires", categorized by similarities in DNA sequences. Other members of this group include
                        Rodentia, Lagomorphs, Scandentia, and Dermoptera.

                        Most primates have evolved to be masters of the arboreal environment. Thus, their hands are very good
                        at grasping and most have opposable thumbs. Every primate has five inward-facing digits, as well as 
                        fingernails and sensitive pads on each fingertip. Primates have enlarged clavicles, giving their 
                        shoulders broad motion while brachiating. Sight is the primary sense for primates and, as such, they
                        have forward-facing eyes and binocular vision (useful in depth percetpion). Primates therefore have 
                        reduced snouts because smell has less significance. Primateshave larger brains than usual for their 
                        body size, and many live in complex social groups.

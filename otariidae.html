                        Otariidae belongs the group of carnivorans known as "Caniformia", which encompasses all doglike carnivorans,
                        characterized by a longer snout than feliforms.
                        Other families of Caniformia include Canidae, Ursidae, and Mustelidae. Additionally, Otariidae belongs to a
                        group known as the "Pinnipedia", which includes all marine, fin-footed caniforms. The other families in 
                        this group are Phocidae and Odobenidae. They are however more closely related to the latter than the former.

                        Otariidae are a group of marine carnivorans specialized to survive in the cold ocean. This family includes
                        eared seals and sea lions. Like all pinnipeds, they have streamlined, flexible bodies with slick fur and
                        limbs modified into flippers for maximum movement capabilities in the water. They have large eye orbits, 
                        short snouts, and less teeth than normal for carnivorans. They also have blubber under their skin to keep
                        them warm. More specifically, Otariidae have very strong forlimbs and pectoral muscles, allowing them to 
                        walk on all fours. They are less adapted to water than phocids and spend more time on land, but can however
                        reach higher speeds than Phocids. They have sharp, well-developed canine teeth and, as their name suggests, 
                        they have external ears.
